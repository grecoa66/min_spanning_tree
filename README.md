# min_spanning_tree
This is an algorithm that I wrote for a design and analysis of algorithms course at Rowan University. The algorithm is based on prims algorithm to find the minimum spanning tree between a set of points (weigthed, non-directional graph). All data structures were hand written by myself in a previous course (data structures and algorithms)
